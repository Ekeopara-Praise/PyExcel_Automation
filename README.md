# EXCEL AUTOMATION IN PYTHON
1-2 months operational time reduced to 1-2 minutes

## Background 

The future of digitalization is automation and this is true considering the various 
benefits associated with it. These benefits include; time, cost, safety and other 
savings. In this project, we will be seeing a real-life project, where the Python 
programming language was used to automate a process thereby reducing 99.55% of
time the actual project should have taken if done manually while ensuring accuracy.
 
## Problem Statement

Figure 1 shows the problem structure where A, B, C are spreadsheets in .xlsx, .xlsx 
and **.data** respectively. Sheet A contains the source data containing multiple rows

of data which will be inserted into sheet B. Sheet B is the actual sheet that are 
containing 18 cells to be modified. Once the sheet B is modified, they are now 
exported as sheet C in .data format, compactible with Schlumberger Eclipse.

## Cost of Manual Solution

The challenges and cost of running this imputation manually based on how scattered 
the 18 cells are, are estimated to take up to **1-2 months**. However, this method is 
prone to **human errors** which will affect the simulation plan. Since the success of 
the simulation is probabilistic, then the whole editing process might be iterative, 
hence requiring more time.
